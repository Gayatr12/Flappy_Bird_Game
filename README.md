# Flappy_Bird_Game<br>

In this project, instead of a bird playing the game, we have a small red-dot. Apart from the red-dot, everything else looks and feels like same as the flappy-bird game app, including the background, pillars, etc.<br>
The aim of the game is to control the bird(red-dot) and move into the spaces between the pillars. The hard part is to control the bird. You will score 1 point every time if you pass the green pillar successfully. <br>
